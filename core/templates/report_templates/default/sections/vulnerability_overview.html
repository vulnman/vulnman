            {% blocktrans %}
            The risk ratings assigned to each vulnerability are determined by averaging several aspects of the exploit
            and the environment, including reputation, difficulty,
            and criticality.

                    {% blocktrans %}
                    Critical vulnerabilities pose a serious threat to an organization's security, and should be fixed
                    immediately.
                    They may provide a total compromise of the target environment, or similar critical impacts.

                    {% blocktrans %}
                    High risk vulnerabilities provide a serious risk to the company environment and should
                    be corrected promptly. These issues can significantly affect the organization's security
                    posture.

                    {% blocktrans %}
                        Medium severity vulnerabilities represent a moderate risk to the environment. They may
                    require additional context before remediation but should be remediated after critical
                    and high risks.

                <td>
                    {% blocktrans %}
                    Low severity vulnerabilities provide minimal risk to the target environment, and often
                    theoretical in nature. Remediation of low risks is often a lower priority than other
                    security hardening techniques.

                    {% blocktrans %}
                    Informational vulnerabilities have little-or-no impact to the target scope by themselves.
                    They are included however, as they may be a risk when combined with other
                    circumstances or technologies not currently in place. Remediation of informational items
                    is not necessary.
