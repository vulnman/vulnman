# Vulnman

[Vulnman](https://vulnman.github.io) is an open source pentest management application written in Python using the powerful Django framework.

It aims to have a central place to manage vulnerabilities and other penetration assets.
The report generation should be as simple as possible to allow the analyst to focus on finding bugs.


**This project is in an early stage! There are most likely stuff that just does not work!**

**There may be breaking changes in the database layout, do not use this project for any production data that you do not want to lose!**

Vulnman also wants to support bug hunters in reporting their vulnerabilities to the vendor using Responsible Disclosure.

Feel free to test the current state and report bugs and ideas to improve vulnman.
